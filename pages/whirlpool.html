                        The Whirlpool Galaxy, also known as Messier 51a, M51a, and NGC 5194, is an interacting[7] grand-design[8]
                        spiral galaxy with a Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus[9] in the constellation Canes Venatici. It was the
                        first galaxy to be classified as a spiral galaxy.[10] Recently it was estimated to be 23 Â± 4 million
                        light-years from the Milky Way,[3] but different methods yield distances between 15 and 35 million
                        light-years. Messier 51 is one of the best known galaxies in the sky
